# PKP2600SI-Arduino-CAN-Controller
This project is for an Arduino-based CAN controller to control the Blink Marine PKP-2600-SI CAN keypad.  I made a custom PCB shield with an automotive connector on board and have a 3D printed case to go along with it so you can utilize common Arduino UNOs and MCP2515 CAN breakout boards in an automotive environment.
